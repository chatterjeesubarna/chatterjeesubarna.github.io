<p align="justify">Hi, you've reached the official website of Subarna Chatterjee, that's me by the way! If you've seen my previous website, you might be wondering why I chose to migrate to a new website. Well, my research career till date has repeatedly taught me the significance of demonstration. A "good" demonstration has precise content presented in an elementary, yet wise manner. I thought my previous website was imprecisely articulated. Hence, I chose fix it up!</p>

<p align="justify">I am a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu">DAta System laboratory</a> (DASlab) <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu">John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a> since January 2019. Before that I was a post-doctoral researcher (2017-2018)  with the Myriads team at Inria, Rennes in France. I did my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>, India from 2013-2017. Broadly, I work in data science with my research focus centering around multiple sub-directions at different times in my career. In my Ph.D., I have worked on sensor networks, cloud computing, and the interactions of the two techonologies towards realization of the Internet of Things. My thesis was on "<a href="https://chatterjeesubarna.github.io/files/Thesis.pdf">Sensors-As-A-Service: Towards the Conceptualization of Sensor-Cloud</a>". In my first post-doc at Inria, I focused on the performance of stream processing platforms (Apache Flink, Apache Storm, and Twitter Heron) on different combinations of workload and hardware. As no stream processing engine is "perfect", the goal of the work was to design a rulebase that guides the optimal choice of a stream processing platform for a given workload and hardware. </p>
