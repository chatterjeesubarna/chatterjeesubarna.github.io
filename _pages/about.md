<font size="-1">Hi, you've reached the official website of Subarna Chatterjee, that's me by the way! If you've seen my previous website, you might be wondering why I chose to migrate to a new website. Well, my research career till date has repeatedly taught me the significance of demonstration. A "good" demonstration has precise content presented in an elementary, yet wise manner. I thought my previous website was imprecisely articulated. Hence, I chose fix it up! 

Academically speaking, I am a post-doctoral researcher at John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University since January 2019. Before that I was a post-doctoral researcher (2017-2018)  with the Myriads team at Inria, Rennes in France. I did my Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India from 2013-2017. Broadly, I work in data science with my research focus centering around multiple sub-directions at different times in my career. In my Ph.D., I have worked on sensor networks, cloud computing, and the interactions of the two techonologies towards realization of the Internet of Things. My thesis was on "<a href="https://chatterjeesubarna.github.io/files/Thesis.pdf">Sensors-As-A-Service: Towards the Conceptualization of Sensor-Cloud</a>".</font>
