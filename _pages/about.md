<font face="helvetica"><p align="justify">Hi, you've reached the official website of Subarna Chatterjee! I thought my previous website was imprecisely articulated. Hence, I chose to fix it up!</p></font>

<font face="helvetica"><p align="justify">I am a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu">Data Systems laboratory</a> at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a> since January 2019. Before that I was a post-doctoral researcher (2017-2018)  with the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/myriads/">Myriads</a> team at Inria, Rennes in France. I did my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>, India from 2013-2017. Broadly, I work in data science with my research focus centering around different sub-directions at different times in my career. In my Ph.D., I have worked on sensor networks, cloud computing, and the interactions of the two techonologies towards realization of the Internet of Things. In my first post-doc at Inria, I focused on the performance of data stream processing platforms (Apache Flink, Apache Storm, and Twitter Heron) on different combinations of workload and hardware. As no stream processing engine is "perfect", the goal of the work was to design a rulebase that guides the optimal choice of a stream processing platform for a given workload and hardware. Now at Harvard, I'm working on data structures and databases and how they impact the bigger technological goals in data science. It is fascinating to observe how the design of data structures have been the core of computer science since its inception and how they still drive the performance of contemporary data analytics in every field of computer science -- from artificial intelligence, to robotics, databases, and systems. In fact, the power of data structures go beyond computer science to basic sciences -- physical science, life science, astronomical science, and even genomics.</p></font>


<font face="helvetica"><p align="justify">My favourite passtime is a random selection from the set of activities that include touring bizarre yet alluring locations, staying musical, devouring and cooking delicious meals, and debating on the different facets and philosophy in the lives of human beings! </p></font>
