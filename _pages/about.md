Hi, you've reached the official website of Subarna Chatterjee, that's me by the way! If you've seen my previous website, you might be wondering why I chose to migrate to a new website. Well, my research career till date has repeatedly taught me the significance of demonstration in almost anything in life. A "good" demonstration has a precise content presented in an elementary, yet wise manner. I thought my previous website was imprecisely articulated. Hence, I chose fix it up! 

I am a post-doctoral researcher at John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University since January 2019. Before that I was a post-doctoral researcher (2017-2018) at Inria, Rennes in France. I did my Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India from 2013-2017.
