<font face="helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Hi, you've reached the official website of Subarna Chatterjee! I thought my previous website was imprecisely articulated. Hence, I chose to fix it up!</p></font>

<font face="helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">I am a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu">Data Systems laboratory</a> at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a> since January 2019. Before that I was a post-doctoral researcher (2017-2018)  with the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/myriads/">Myriads</a> team at Inria, Rennes in France. I did my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>, India from 2013-2017. Broadly, I work in data science with my research focus centering around different sub-directions at different times in my career.</p></font>

<font face="helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">At Harvard, I'm working on data structures and databases and how they impact the bigger technological goals in data science. It is fascinating to observe how the design of data structures have been the core of computer science since its inception and how they still drive the performance of contemporary data analytics in every field of computer science -- from artificial intelligence, to robotics, databases, and systems. In fact, the power of data structures go beyond computer science to basic sciences -- physical science, life science, astronomical science, and even genomics.</p></font>


<font face="helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">My favourite passtime is a pseudo-random selection from a set that includes touring and exploring bizarre yet alluring geographic locations, staying musical (<i>in a mostly Indian way</i>), playing board/card games, devouring and cooking delicious meals, and debating on the different facets and philosophy in the lives of human beings! </p></font>
